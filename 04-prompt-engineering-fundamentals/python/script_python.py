### 2. Use that in the prompt template below
prompt = f"""
```{text}```

# Example text
text = f"""
Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the \
largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with \
a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half \
times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. \
Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye \
in the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations since \
before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter.[19] \
When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected \
light to cast visible shadows,[20] and is on average the third-brightest \
natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

## Set the prompt

Summarize content you are provided with for a second-grade student.
